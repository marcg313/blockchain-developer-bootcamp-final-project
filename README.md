# blockchain-developer-bootcamp-final-project

The final project idea is to create a loyalty token system to be used by both online and in-store retail outlets. 
Payments are made using cryptocurrency.
Tokens will be rewarded to the users for each purchase they make.
Once the user has collected enough tokens they can redeem them with their next purchase. 
Tokens can be collected and redeemed in different stores. Ie. if you collect 10 tokens from McDonalds, these can be redeemed in another participating store like Costa Coffee. This is to create a community.
Currently you can only redeem coupons in the same store. Ie buy 4 coffees get one free.

The token will need to be created. Ie Marcs Tokens 
Need to include the option for users to pay by visa (and exchange rate calculations)
More notes to follow.
