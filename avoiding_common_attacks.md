## Avoiding Common Attacks

### SWC-102 - Using Specific Compiler Pragma
Contracts should be deployed with the same compiler version and flags that they have been tested the most with. This contract should use a compiler version later or equals to 0.8 with address payable being used and OpenZeppelin Contracts library being imported.

`pragma solidity >=0.8.0 <0.9.0;`

### SWC-110 - Proper Use of Require, Assert and Revert 
With the contract a simple one and we don't want all gas being burned, Require() is practically more suitable.

E.g.: 'require(guess == 0 || guess == 1, "Variable 'guess' should be either 0 ('heads') or 1 ('tails')")'
